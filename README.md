To-Do App
A simple and intuitive task management application built using React.js. The app allows users to efficiently organize and track their daily tasks. Key features include:

Task Addition: Users can add tasks with ease using a responsive input form.
Task Deletion: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks with a single click.
Task Completion: Mark tasks as completed to track progress.
Form Validation: Prevents adding blank tasks for a seamless user experience.
This project demonstrates clean component-based architecture, controlled form handling, and dynamic rendering in React.js.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
